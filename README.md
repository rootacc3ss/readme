not much to say... right now, at least...

#update 04-28-2025
i am going to make it a committment to open source some of my projects (and make some open source resources and tools) as almost all are private.

i have been helped so much by those who open source their work -- it's time for me to give back!

i am working on an MCP Server that allows you to integrate Microsoft Azure products and resources in to your vibe coding with ease. i will definitely make that open source!

love ya
