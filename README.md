# readme
welcome! this page will serve as the only place to get updates on projects that i am updating to the public and to see which social media accounts are mine. 
`this readme is a work in progress.`

## bio
hello! i am `rootacc3ss`, aka `keygen`. 

i am a serial entrepreneur, OSINT/CSINT enthusiast, ex-greyhat social engineer, finance gremlin (i live on the charts and in the reports; ES keeps me fed); really, i am just a chronically online individual who knows his way around money and tech.

i am 100% an autist and just about everything interests me, so expect projects across a wide array of fields.

i own a decently successful company, [sacraventures](https://sacra.ventures), incorporated in the USA and Malta.

currently, my team and i are working on a few large SaaS projects -- one that has patent pending machine learning technology -- as well as a multitude of other projects that have been in the works for years.

i primarily use github for private repository management, but i absolutely plan on dropping some bangers soon.

thanks for reading! feel free to get in touch for any reason at all.

regards,
ra/keygen
